To implement privacy settings for each quote in your database, you can introduce an additional attribute to represent the privacy level of each quote. Here's an example of how you can handle this feature:

1. Database Schema: Add a new field, such as `privacy`, to your quote table in the database. The `privacy` field can be an enumeration or a string that represents the privacy level of the quote. For instance, you can define privacy levels like "public," "private," or "friends-only."

2. Privacy Options: Determine the different privacy options you want to offer users. The options can vary based on your app's requirements and user preferences. In the example above, "public" indicates that the quote is visible to all users, "private" means it's only visible to the quote owner, and "friends-only" restricts visibility to the quote owner's approved friends.

3. User Authorization: Ensure that you have an authentication and authorization system in place. When a user creates or updates a quote, verify their credentials and permissions to determine the allowed privacy level for the quote.

4. Quote Retrieval: When retrieving quotes, consider the privacy level set for each quote and include appropriate logic to filter the quotes based on the privacy level and the viewing user's relationship with the quote owner. For example, if a user is browsing their own quotes, they should see all their quotes regardless of privacy settings. However, when browsing quotes from other users, only the ones with a privacy level set to "public" or "friends-only" (if the viewing user is a friend) should be visible.

5. User Profile and Settings: Allow users to manage their privacy settings in their profile or settings section. This could include the ability to set the default privacy level for their quotes or to override the privacy level on a per-quote basis.

6. UI Considerations: In the user interface, you can indicate the privacy level of each quote, such as displaying an icon or label representing the privacy setting. This helps users understand the visibility of their quotes and adjust their settings accordingly.

By incorporating a `privacy` attribute in your quote table and incorporating the necessary logic in your application, you can effectively handle the privacy settings for each quote in your database. This way, users can have control over the visibility of their quotes and ensure they are shared according to their preferences.

Remember to thoroughly test your privacy settings to ensure they work as expected and maintain the desired level of security and privacy for your users.
